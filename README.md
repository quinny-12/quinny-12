## My name is Quinn Downey and I’m 18 years old. I’m currently finishing my senior year at Lane Tech and will be a freshman at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign next year studying Statistics + Computer Science. As a huge fan of football and baseball, I plan to combine my passions for sports, math, and coding into a career as a sports data scientist. My goal is to work in analytics for a professional organization like the NFL or MLB.
