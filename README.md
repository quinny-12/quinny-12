## My name is Quinn Downey and I'm a senior at Lane Tech. I'm an Irish dancer and I work regularly year-round at the Neighborhood Boys and Girls Club at Revere Park. I aspire to be a data scientist in the sports industry, ideally using predictive modeling to help NFL coaches make game-time decisions.
